/**
 * Element → ledger-event reveal mapping for the hero island's night replay
 * (ROADMAP Phase B.2, docs/ROADMAP.md Known debt #3: "night replay
 * ghosts/thresholds partly hardcoded to the seeded story"). Scene.tsx's
 * "ghost artifact" layer used to gate purely on seed constants (night
 * 12/41/63, `sampleIsland.ts` GHOSTS); this module derives the same three
 * thresholds from the REAL machine-curiosity ledger when it's reachable,
 * falling back to the seed constants — per-ghost, not all-or-nothing — when
 * a given trigger event isn't found (offline-identical-rendering rule,
 * architecture.md "every call is best-effort").
 *
 * Element → event correspondence (see `apps/server/src/seed.ts`
 * `seedSampleIsland`, g1/g2/g3 — the seed's own choice of action per ghost):
 *
 *   | ghost       | trigger action        | occurrence | seed example (seed.ts) |
 *   |-------------|------------------------|-----------:|-------------------------|
 *   | 'card'      | `return_to_driftwood`  | 1st        | g1 @ night 12, "被撤下的问题卡" |
 *   | 'prototype' | `refute`               | 1st        | g2 @ night 41, "实验坊原型宣告失败" |
 *   | 'canvas'    | `return_to_driftwood`  | 2nd        | g3 @ night 63, "一张画布被废弃" |
 *
 * `refute` is one of `TIMELINE_MARKER_ACTIONS` (packages/core/night-timeline
 * .ts) — the 'prototype' ghost lines up exactly with a real golden-dot
 * scrubber marker. `return_to_driftwood` is deliberately NOT in that list
 * (it's "ambient" there) but it is the exact action the seed authored for
 * the card/canvas ghosts, so we key on it directly here rather than widen
 * TIMELINE_MARKER_ACTIONS, which is owned by the B.2 contract in
 * packages/core and shared with the scrubber UI.
 *
 * Honest scope: only these three thresholds are ledger-driven. The rest of
 * the night layer (hanging lanterns, night-argument tag, AI-night-watch /
 * synthesizer-draft tags, fireflies) has no 1:1 event correspondence baked
 * into the bespoke SVG and stays a "performance" layer, gated only by
 * `night` — see the outstanding list in docs/ROADMAP.md §3.3.
 *
 * Scale note: `nightT` (the scrubber's `t` prop, 1..86) is still driven by
 * NightTimeline.tsx's hardcoded `<input type=range min=1 max=86>` — that
 * component is owned by a parallel lane migrating it to consume
 * `NightTimelineModel` directly. Until it does, a real ledger's `nights`
 * (often far fewer than 86 — a handful of real days, not the seed's 86-night
 * story) is rescaled onto the legacy 1..86 axis so the existing slider still
 * reveals ghosts across its full sweep instead of all-at-once in the first
 * few percent. Delete `LEGACY_SCRUBBER_NIGHTS` and this rescale once
 * NightTimeline consumes `model.nights` as its own axis.
